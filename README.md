# hello-world
Tutorial project
I am a software engineer who primarily writes in C# on Windows, but I'm interested in exploring Linux and other languages and editors and development environments.
I am especially interested in:
* Visual Code
* Emacs
* Vi/Vim
* Lisp (probably using Emacs and Slime which I already started a few years ago)
* Prolog
* F#
* .Net Core and cross-platform C#
* C++ (especially modern C++11 and C++14)
